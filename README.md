# BoltLock: A Smart Lock System

BoltLock is a WiFi-Based Door Lock Controller with Mobile Notifications

It's built using DFRobot FireBeetle ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework to support remote locking/unlocking via a mobile app.
The system sends notifications to the user's smartphone whenever the lock state changes, ideally through Discord.
